/**
 * Objective of this problem is to improvise our stream API usage and develop the sense of functional programming.
 * Following code addresses one of the requirements in live sessions service.
 * QuestionSession object represents question response we get for a user from assessment service.
 * <p>
 * You will find all kinds of antipatterns here starting with
 * 1. Long method
 * 2. Duplicated code
 * 3. Non extensible
 * 4. Non readable
 * 5. Too many dangling variables
 * 6. Qualifies for the famous comment "When I wrote this, only God and I understood what I was doing. Now, God only knows"
 * <p>
 * Task:
 * 1. Refactor the code so that its more manageable
 * 2. Has no duplicate code
 * 3. There is no single imperative style for loop in code. Meaning, no "for (Object o: objects)" or "for (int i; i < something; i++)" types loops.
 * 4. Don't hack by replacing for loops with do..while or while loops
 * 5. SummaryServiceImplTest must pass without having to touch that class
